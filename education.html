					<p style = "text-indent : 3em;">I started my early education in Tadika Sinar Pintar which located just 15 minutes away from my home. I can still remember vividly every moment my father sent me off to the kindergarten using his motorcycle every morning before he gone to his work place in Shah Alam. </p>
					<p style = "text-indent : 3em;">Follow up to the next stage, I have attended a private primary school in Klang, which named as Sekolah Rendah Islam Hira'. At there I have been introduced with so many things academically and religously as the school is practicing Islamic culture and environment in total. 
													Every morning, I will join tadarrus and hafazan Al-Quran before the classes start. There are many other practices which apparently I think were helping me building my personality as whole. As an institution that supposedly to teaches and gives early education in various aspects 
													to children who are in the process of developing self perspectives and early understanding about life, I believes that the school provides a complete education that implement both academic and religion diligently. Thus, I really appreciate every single knowledge and 
													efforts from the teachers there because atleast I have a glimpse knowledge of Islam for me to practice them now and in the future.</p>
					<p style = "text-indent : 3em;">After UPSR, I have enrolled in Sekolah Agama Menengah Tinggi Sultan Hishamuddin where I study and take my PT3, as the second batch of PT3 candidates in 2015. Receiving a good result for my PT3, I applied both <abbr title="MARA Junior Science College">MRSM</abbr> and 
													<abbr title="Sekolah Berasrama Penuh">SBP</abbr> because I want to challenge myself in experiencing some changes, especially in boarding school environment. Lucky for me, I have got offer letter from both MRSM Kuala Krai, Kelantan and Kolej Islan Sultan Alam Shah (KISAS), Klang. 
													Nevertheless, I was overwhelmed and panicked as I do not know which school I really wanted to go. After long thought, I decided to enter <a href="https://m.facebook.com/pages/category/Religious-School/Kolej-Islam-Sultan-Alam-Shah-Official-191199154273963/" target="self">KISAS</a> 
													as it is located nearer to my home rather than MRSM which located in Kelantan. That way, my parents would not worrying about me too much. Again, I am glad that i chose to attend KISAS as it is one of the prestigious SBP which also an Islamic school. 
													There, I learned so many things besides my academic, more than i have learned in my middle school. They teached me about Biah Solehah, ukhuwah, and other Islamic matters in detail. I also noticed that I should level up my effort in studies in science streams class as all the students 
													there were really smart, and the competition is always getting intense when it comes to academic purposes. However, despites being stressed out in my study, I know that I love the environment there and I will be touched whenever I recall all the memories created during those time. </p>
					<p style = "text-indent : 3em;">Enough with the story of me and schools. Now, we are getting into how I decided my real passion to further the study in higher institutions. I was naturally made my decision. As a student from Science streams class, I surely can further my study in the same field. However, because of 
													my results for Science subjects in SPM did not satisfied me eventhough I have got between B+ to C+ which is satisfying enough for most people, I rather further my study in other field that I think I can score better than continue with sciences and only get moderate results 
													despites my deep affection towards science. That is why I have chosen Diploma of Library Management in Universiti Teknologi MARA as my first choice eventhough I did not even know what I will learn throughout the semesters. Alhamdulillah, I still survived with all the courses of each 
													semester even the number of assignments is really hold me back.</p>
					<p style = "text-indent : 3em;">Accomplishing my diploma was hard, but living my live today and studying my degree is harder! Ofcourse with different obstacles and hindrances. For your information, I am currently further my study with Bachelor in Information Sciences (Hons) Rrecords Management. 
													I know, the degree i chose is in slightly different path from Library Sciences, but I chose Records Management because it can leads me into medical field. I guessed I still love the idea being in medical environment eventhough I will just operationg the records, not the patients. 
													I hope that I can finish my degree with flying colours, within the stated timeframe so that I can attend my convocation with my fellow classmates and cherish the moment happily together with my family.</p>
